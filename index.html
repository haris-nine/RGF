                    <h2>Avoiding Default Judgement</h2>
                    <p>If you fail to file the ET3 or file it late, the tribunal may rule against you without a hearing. This is called a "default judgement," where the claimant wins without you having the opportunity to defend yourself. A solicitor will ensure the ET3 is filed on time and correctly.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="text">
                    <h2>Constructing a Solid Defence</h2>
                    <p>The ET3 forms the foundation of your defence. A solicitor's expertise will be crucial in crafting a well-reasoned and legally sound defence, setting the stage for a strong case.

                    <h2>Expert Legal Advice</h2>
                    <p>A solicitor can offer expert advice on the best way to defend the claim, drawing on their knowledge of employment law and tribunal procedures. They can also advise on the potential implications of different courses of action.</p>

                    <h2>Evidence and Witness Management</h2>
                    <p>A solicitor will understand the importance of evidence in tribunal cases. They can guide you on gathering and presenting evidence effectively, as well as preparing your witnesses for the hearing.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Negotiating Settlements</h2>
                    <p>While the goal is to win the case, a solicitor can also explore settlement options with the claimant. They can negotiate on your behalf and advise on the best course of action, potentially saving you time and money.

                    <h2>Reducing Costs</h2>
                    <p>While hiring a solicitor involves upfront costs, they can potentially save you money in the long run. A strong defence can prevent a large award being made against you, and a solicitor's negotiation skills can lead to a favourable settlement.
